# It's selfie time!
With the use of Tensorflow framework and ResNet model, we trained a programm that recognises the authors of this project.

And it's corect!

# Social Distancing

For this part of the project we used Tensorflow framework and RetineNet model. After training our app to recognise objects in an image, we thought about using it 
to count the number of persons in an image and calculate the distance between them, in order to find out how many people do not respect social distancing during coronavirus epidemic.
